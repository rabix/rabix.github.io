# (DRAFT) An opinionated introduction to CWL

The word "Language" in "Common Workflow Language" has nuances. 
A CWL document is a high level description of a workflow that 
can be passed to a CWL enabled workflow runner which then takes
care of orchestrating all the parts of the workflow.

CWL is different from every other workflow system out there in
that it is a community driven "implementation by specification" 
rather than a single entity "specification by implementation"
effort.
